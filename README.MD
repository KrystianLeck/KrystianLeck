### Featured Projects

#### 🛡️ [MITRE ATT&CK: Modeling and Evaluation](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/MITRE-Attack-Lab-Project)
This project is the technical implementation of a Master's Thesis, focusing on the practical application of the MITRE ATT&CK framework to evaluate and enhance defensive systems. It involved the development of an isolated laboratory environment to simulate real-world adversarial scenarios and verify the effectiveness of multi-layered security controls.
* **Project Goal:** To assess the detection and mitigation capabilities of Windows-based infrastructures against specific adversarial techniques identified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
* **Simulation & Analysis:** Utilizing the Atomic Red Team framework to execute controlled attack scenarios, including process injection, credential dumping (LSASS), and unauthorized network reconnaissance.
* **Advanced Detection & Visibility:** Demonstrating that high-fidelity telemetry through expert configuration of native system tools (such as Sysmon and PowerShell Script Block Logging) enables effective incident identification without commercial SIEM solutions.
* **Active Defense & Hardening:** Implementing "Defense in Depth" strategies by automating real-time incident responses and enhancing overall system resilience through kernel-level hardening and behavioral prevention.

#### 🏢 [Secure Active Directory Infrastructure Lab](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/Secure-Active-Directory-Lab)
A comprehensive deployment of a corporate IT infrastructure designed to demonstrate modern administrative practices and system hardening. This project focuses on the integration of identity management and network security within a virtualized domain environment.
* **Infrastructure Design:** Deployment of a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller with AD DS and DNS services in an isolated virtual network.
* **IAM & RBAC:** Implementation of a logical Organizational Unit (OU) structure and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring users follow the Principle of Least Privilege.
* **Security Hardening:** Strengthening the domain environment through Group Policy Objects (GPO), including administrative tool restrictions and account lockout policies to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Data Integrity:** Configuration of secure file services using granular NTFS permissions and inheritance management to protect sensitive organizational assets.

#### 🐧 [Linux Security Auditor](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/Linux-Security-Auditor)
Bash automation tool for rapid baseline security auditing on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
* **Audit:** Verifies firewall (UFW) status and network service exposure.
* **Hardening:** Scans for credential vulnerabilities and account misconfigurations.

#### 🏗️ [Mechanical Strength Testing App](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/Mechanical-Strength-Testing-App)
A specialized engineering application developed for my Engineering Thesis:
* **Functionality:** Automates strength of materials calculations and generates professional reports in **PDF format** using JavaScript.
