### Featured Projects

#### 🛡️ [MITRE ATT&CK: Modeling and Evaluation](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/MITRE-Attack-Lab-Project)
This project is the technical implementation of a Master's Thesis, focusing on the practical application of the MITRE ATT&CK framework to evaluate and enhance defensive systems. It involved the development of an isolated laboratory environment to simulate real-world adversarial scenarios and verify the effectiveness of multi-layered security controls.
* **Project Goal:** To assess the detection and mitigation capabilities of Windows-based infrastructures against specific adversarial techniques identified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
* **Simulation & Analysis:** Utilizing the Atomic Red Team framework to execute controlled attack scenarios, including process injection, credential dumping (LSASS), and unauthorized network reconnaissance.
* **Advanced Detection & Visibility:** Demonstrating that high-fidelity telemetry through expert configuration of native system tools (such as Sysmon and PowerShell Script Block Logging) enables effective incident identification without commercial SIEM solutions.
* **Active Defense & Hardening:** Implementing "Defense in Depth" strategies by automating real-time incident responses and enhancing overall system resilience through kernel-level hardening and behavioral prevention.

#### 🏢 [Secure Active Directory Infrastructure Lab](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/Secure-Active-Directory-Infrastructure)
A Windows Server 2022 laboratory environment focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM):
* **Hardening:** Deployed strict **GPO policies** to restrict administrative tools (CMD) and enforce account lockout protection.
* **RBAC:** Configured logical OU structures and granular **NTFS permissions** based on the Principle of Least Privilege.

#### 🐧 [Linux Security Auditor](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/Linux-Security-Auditor)
A **Bash-based automation tool** for baseline security audits on Debian/Ubuntu systems:
* **Features:** Audits UFW status, analyzes listening network ports, and scans for credential vulnerabilities in `/etc/shadow`.

#### 🏗️ [Mechanical Strength Testing App](https://github.com/KrystianLeck/Mechanical-Strength-Testing-App)
A specialized engineering application developed for my Engineering Thesis:
* **Functionality:** Automates strength of materials calculations and generates professional laboratory reports in **PDF format** using JavaScript.
